// weakMap.set(key, value)
// weakMap.get(key)
// weakMap.delete(key)

/*The main aread of application for WeakMap is an additonal data storage. 

If we are working with an object that belongs to another code. maybe even a third party library and would like to store some data associated with it. that should only exist while the object is alive-then WeakMap is exactly what's needed.

We put the data to a WeakMap,using the object as the key, and when the object is garbage collected, that data will automatically , diappear as well.

// WeakMap and WeakSet are used as ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù data structures in addition to the ‚Äúprimary‚Äù object storage. Once the object is removed from the primary storage, if it is only found as the key of WeakMap or in a WeakSet, it will be cleaned up automatically.
